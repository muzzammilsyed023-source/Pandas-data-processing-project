# Pandas Data Processing Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple data processing pipeline using **Python and Pandas**.  
It focuses on ingesting raw employee data, cleaning and transforming it, and generating an analytics-ready dataset suitable for reporting or downstream ETL processes.

The project reflects a common **data engineering preprocessing workflow**.
